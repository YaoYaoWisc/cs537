Description:

A)
Provided 2 files: mysh.c and Makefile

B)
Along with xv6 source code, provided data files and plots in data.png in the p2 handin directory
The data was generated bu running modified version of ticks.c from the test suite. The file is
in user/ directory of xv6. For the first plot, ratio of tickets was 2:4, while for the other
one it was 2:8. The program ticks take sleep count as the argument. Both, this behavior and
tickets ration can be changed from user/ticks.
The scheduler was tested with processes which fairly require a longer duratioion of time compared
to the time slice allotted by the the scheduler. Hence the processer remain in the higher priority
only for the first slice and hence the hticks=1 for these processes. The graph presented with this 
assignment depicts the lticks against the sleep time length. So all the data on the graph
corresponds to the lower priority queue that is with proc->queue=2.
