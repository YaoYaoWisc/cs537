Project 3a - Brief description
4 functions have been added to the xv6 which perform functions very similar to their existing counterparts:
Mem_Init()
Mem_Alloc(size,style)
Mem_Free(ptr)
Mem_Dump()
We developed the code by testing each function in steps and comparing with the existing functions.
We have tried to optimize the code for better performance and by using limited header overhead.
Finally the functions were verified with testscripts made available.

Project 3b:
We initially concentrated on working with the NULL deference and then gradually extrapollated to working on reallocating the 
address space components into the desired functions.
We wrote custom test functions to verify at multiple levels.
We then spent a significant amount of time in understanding the functioning of the system calls and interrupt handling and 
gradually developed on the concepts to make sure that we are able to catch the interrupts that are of interest to us. 
Then we had to make several additions such as the new function called growstack() and also made modification to handle 
specific trap conditions. 
We spent a huge time working on the boundary conditions and verifying that they are appropriate to the specification.
Finally we tested all the test cases using the modified xv6 and were successful in implementation.
